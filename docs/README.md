# Sync Multiple Google Calendars into One

When you want to sync multiple Google Calendars into one. Currently Google Calendar doesn't have this option and [IFTTT]/[Zapier] don't allow an easy way to do this.

This is useful for a collective Busy/Free Calendar or Google Home integration.

## Why This Fork?

This fork enhances the original project with the following improvements:

**Privacy-Focused Event Naming**
- All synced events now appear as "Nickname Busy" (e.g., "[Alice] Busy", "[Bob] Busy") instead of showing the actual event title
- Original event titles are preserved in the event description for reference
- Perfect for sharing calendars with privacy while still showing availability

**Multiple Calendars Per Person**
- Support for merging multiple calendars under a single nickname
- Use an array of calendar IDs to consolidate personal, work, and other calendars
- Example: `"[Alice]": ["alice-personal@gmail.com", "alice-work@gmail.com"]` shows all events as "[Alice] Busy"

**Simplified Single-File Setup**
- BatchRequest class merged into the main file for easier deployment
- No need to manage multiple script files
- Configuration variables at the top for quick editing

**Enhanced Debugging**
- Detailed console logging to troubleshoot sync issues
- Shows exactly which calendars are being processed and how many events are found
- Helps identify permission or configuration problems quickly

## Getting Starting

1. Make sure every calendar you want sync is shared with the account that holds the shared calendar.

2. Log into the account that holds the shared calendar and go to the [Google Apps Scripts] website.

3. Click on "New Project".

4. Replace everything in `Code.gs` with the contents of [SyncCalendarsIntoOne.gs].

5. Update the configuration at the top of the file:
   - `CALENDARS_TO_MERGE`: Set nicknames and calendar IDs
     - Single calendar: `"[Name]": "calendar-id@gmail.com"`
     - Multiple calendars: `"[Name]": ["cal1@gmail.com", "cal2@gmail.com"]`
   - `CALENDAR_TO_MERGE_INTO`: Your shared calendar ID
   - `SYNC_DAYS_IN_PAST` and `SYNC_DAYS_IN_FUTURE`: Adjust date range as needed
   - Be sure to save.

6. Click the `Project Settings` Gear icon on the left panel. Check the `Show "appsscript.json" manifest file in editor`. Go back to code editor on the left, and update its content with [appsscript.json].

7. Click `Run`. This will load the `Authorization required` window since it's your first time running the script. Click on `Review permissions` and give it permission to your account.

8. Click on `Triggers` clock icon on the left panel to add a trigger. Click on `Add Trigger`.

   - You have two choices, "Time-driven" or "From calendar".
   - Time-driven will run every X minutes/hours/etc. Use this if you have calendars that update frequently (more than 5-10 times in a 15 minute timespan)
   - "From calendar" will run when a given calendar updates. Use this if you want instant merging.

     a. **Time-driven**

     - "Choose which function to run": `SyncCalendarsIntoOne`
     - "Choose which deployment should run": `Head`
     - "Select event source": `Time-driven`
     - "Select type of time based trigger": choose what works for you.
     - Click "Save"

     b. **From calendar**

     - "Choose which function to run": `SyncCalendarsIntoOne`
     - "Choose which deployment should run": `Head`
     - "Select event source": `From calendar`
     - "Enter calendar details": enter one of the calendars you are merging _from_.
     - Click "Save"
     - Repeat these steps for every calendar you're merging _from_.

9. Enjoy!

## Notes

- Google App Scripts has a daily quote of 5k events created per day. See [Quotas for Google Services]
- Be sure to turn off "notifications".
